- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Swayzee20 / Josue Flores, and I'm passionate about coding and pretty much everything I do. I recently graduated from TripleTen coding bootcamp and I've gained a lot of valuable experience where I've worked on several projects.
- The skills i've learned include HTML, CSS, Javascript, MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node, NoSQL, npm, Jest, RestAPI.
- I'm currently working on the backend for my Sports app project, using node, express, and building a Rest API.
